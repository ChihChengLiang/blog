Finally the blog is up! 

Thanks to Gilbert's great article  [http://weichengliou.github.io/blog/blog/2014/08/07/buildblog/](http://weichengliou.github.io/blog/blog/2014/08/07/buildblog/) . Also thanks to the following original toturial too.

Now I have a blog that can embed ipython notebook cells.

{% notebook nbtest.ipynb cells[:] %}


Here is some additional info on setup of pelican, which might save you some time.

- When things get ugly, don't hesitate to `make clean` or `rm output/ -r`. Some bugs ,`'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe6 in position 80: ordinal not in range(128)` for example, that you might not know where to fix, lives in the `output/` directory. 
- Make sure your `cells` in `{ï¼… notebook nbtest.ipynb cells[1:] %}` refers to the correct cells in the ipynb file. (Sorry for that fullwidth percentage sign, one does not simply escape the variable delimiters in pelican)
